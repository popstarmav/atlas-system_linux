# CPython Project

## Overview
This project contains exercises and examples related to CPython, focusing on Python/C API integration and extending Python with C.

## Description
CPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming language, written in C. This repository demonstrates how to:
- Interface with Python objects from C code
- Create Python extensions using C
- Access and manipulate Python data structures in C
- Work with the Python/C API

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- C compiler (gcc recommended)
- Python development headers

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0x08_CPython.git
cd 0x08_CPython
```

## Usage
Each directory contains specific examples and exercises:

```bash
cd example_directory
python3 example_script.py
```
