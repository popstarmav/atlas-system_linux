# Sockets Programming

This repository contains examples and information about socket programming.

## What are Sockets?

Sockets are communication endpoints that allow programs to communicate with each other, either on the same machine or across a network. They provide a bidirectional communication channel between processes.

## Types of Sockets

- **Stream Sockets (SOCK_STREAM)**: Provide reliable, connection-oriented communication using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).
- **Datagram Sockets (SOCK_DGRAM)**: Provide connectionless communication using UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
- **Raw Sockets**: Allow direct access to lower-level protocols.

## Common Socket Operations

- Creating a socket
- Binding to an address
- Listening for connections
- Accepting connections
- Connecting to a server
- Sending and receiving data
- Closing a socket

## Example Use Cases

- Client-server applications
- Web servers and browsers
- Chat applications
- Distributed computing
- Network services

## Getting Started
