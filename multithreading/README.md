# Multithreading

## Overview
Multithreading is a programming concept that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU resources. Threads are lightweight processes that can run simultaneously, sharing the same memory space while having their own stack.

## Key Concepts

### Threads vs Processes
- **Processes**: Independent execution units with their own memory space
- **Threads**: Lightweight units that share memory space within a process

### Benefits of Multithreading
- Improved performance and responsiveness
- Better resource utilization
- Simplified program structure for certain problems
- Enhanced user experience in interactive applications

### Challenges
- Race conditions
- Deadlocks
- Thread synchronization
- Debugging complexity

## Common Multithreading Patterns
1. **Producer-Consumer Pattern**: One thread produces data, another consumes it
2. **Thread Pool Pattern**: Reuse threads to execute multiple tasks
3. **Future/Promise Pattern**: Asynchronous computation with deferred results
